## ER (Entity-Relationship) Model

- A popular high-level conceptual data model 

## Entity and Attributes

### Entity

- An entity is something of importance to a user or organization that needs to be represented in a database
- An entity represents one theme, topic, or business concept
- In the ER model, entities are restricted to things that can be represented using a single table
- *Model Notation:*

### Entity Type and Entity Set

- **Entity type**
    - Entities with the same basic attributes are grouped or typed into an eitity type
- **Entity set (collection)**
    - A collection of entities of an entity type
    - The entity set is the current *state* of the entities of that type that are stored in the database

### Attribute

- Attributes are properties used to describe an entity
- Each attribute has a value set (or data type) associated with it
- *Model Notation:*

![Attribute Notation]()

#### Types of Attributes

- Simple
- Composite
- Multi-valued
- Derived

#### Key Attributes

- An attribute of an eitity type for which each entity must have a unique value is called a **key attribute** of the entity type
