## What is Data?

- Known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning
- Data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing
- Numbers, words, measurements, descriptions, etc.
- Need a way to **store** and **retrieve** data in correct, convenient, efficient, and secure manner
- *It is acceptable for the word **data** to be used as both singular and plural*

### Is this Data?

```python
x = [1365.81, 1247.18, 318.457, 252.1648, 202.91]
```
- Yes, but it is meaningless

### With Attribute

```python
population = [1365.81, 1247.18, 318.457, 252.1648, 202.91]
```
- We know better, but still not very useful

### With Another Variable

```python
placeWithPopInMil = {"China":1365.81, "India":1247.18, "USA":318.457, "Indonesia":252.1648, "Brazil":202.91}
```
- Much better, but need more; maybe we could also use dates for recordkeeping
